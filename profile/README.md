## Overview

**Eclipse Muto** is an open-source, declarative orchestrator for managing ROS (Robot Operating System) software stacks on edge devices. It is an approach to robotics infrastructure management, enabling cloud-native orchestration of distributed ROS systems while maintaining the real-time performance and deterministic behavior required for robotic applications.

It is designed to provide an an adaptive framework and that allows for dynamically composable model-driven software stacks for ROS during runtime. This allows Muto to modify the software solution to address some of the runtime adaptivity challenges in autonomous and robotic platforms based on policies or current context.


## What Makes Muto Unique

Eclipse Muto bridges the gap between traditional ROS development and modern cloud-native orchestration by providing a **model-based approach** to robot software management. Unlike conventional deployment methods that require manual intervention and physical access to devices, Muto enables declarative stack definitions that can be managed, versioned, and deployed remotely across entire robot fleets.

It is Adaptive; Muto is a context aware software solution to address some of the runtime adaptivity challenges in autonomous and robotic platforms. Adaptive Muto stacks support connected architectures for autonomous and software-defined vehicles, including supporting cloud-based apps and services that can dynamically change.  

It is Extensible; Muto is built on an extensible architecture. Similar to plugins and the extension points that are foundational to Eclipse extensibility. many of Muto's functionality are implemented as plugins that you can easily replace and modify for your requirements. You can add new ROS nodes for controlling, monitoring, composing and adapting vehicle behavior as plugins.
